1) First step is to get node js and npm to our server.
visit npmjs documentation there they guide you to installing nodejs. when we install nodejs, npm comes with it.

basically it redirects to
https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall
above link.
i used this command from above link
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

after installing both. go to yeoman generator and find meanjs generator.
before installing mean they ask us install some packages in their documentation. please follow it.
